This site contains all of the product documentation for Progen. Progen is the
second incantation of [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen][Dogen]], the MASD code generator. MASD - Model Assisted
Software Development - is a methodology to develop software systems based on
MDE - Model Driven Development. Throughout this site you will find all the
information needed to make sense of these and many other terms, as well as the
rationale for the existence of Progen. This project makes heavy use of the
org-roam approach.
