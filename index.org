This site contains all of the product documentation for Progen. Progen is the
second incantation of [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen][Dogen]], the Model Assisted Software Development (MASD) code
generator. MASD is a methodology to develop software systems[fn:thesis] based on
[[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE - Model Driven Development]]. Throughout this site you will find all the
information needed to make sense of these and many other terms, as well as the
rationale for the existence of Progen. This project makes heavy use of the
[[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html][org-roam]] approach, though if you are consuming it from within a web-browser, it
should not make much difference.

[fn:thesis] MASD was developed as part of my PhD thesis. See [[id:5FA85AF3-E55C-B174-D943-1E2246CAEB14][MASD Academic
Papers]].

* Content

** General Pages

| Page   | Description                    |
|--------+--------------------------------|
| [[id:BA763158-3DC5-E914-BF2B-5C9CABBC3676][Readme]] | The project README in github.  |
| [[id:26C11B63-95AE-D454-4663-0B147D32B568][Progen]] | Details of the project itself. |

** Domain Concepts

This project was originally part of an academic research project, so a lot of
documentation was created describing the domain which it covers. The sections
that follow contain an overview of the main pages, which are then weaved
together using the [[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html][org-roam]] approach. To access the original material, see [[id:5FA85AF3-E55C-B174-D943-1E2246CAEB14][MASD
Academic Papers]].

*** Model Driven Engineering

MASD is based on [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][Model Driven Engineering (MDE)]], so its important to understand
the basic concepts of this field and why we found it necessary to extend it.
