Please note that the bulk of this site is a reformatting of my PhD thesis, as
well as of all of the supplemental material that was written to support it ---
papers, research notes, article reviews /etc./ Though extensive bibliographical
references were kept within the site --- and should be suitable for academic
purposes /as is/ --- the same cannot be said about our own content. No efforts
were made in tracing back our own material to their original papers because we
are no longer in academia.

If you are only interested in learning about the concepts or want to code in
this project, you should /use only the content of the site/, because the papers
are frozen in time. If, however, you need access to the originals for academic
purposes, they are as follows:

- [[https://zenodo.org/record/5812017#.YkmlftDMKXI][Notes on Model Driven Engineering]]: Background on MDE.
- [[https://zenodo.org/record/5790875#.YkoSutDMKXI][Survey of Special Purpose Code Generators]]: Short survey of Open Source tools
  dedicated to special purpose code generation.
- [[https://zenodo.org/record/5767247#.YkoS6NDMKXI][Experience Report of Industrial Adoption of Model Driven Development in the
  Financial Sector]]: Our prior experiences of using MDE on an industrial setting.
- [[https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/handle/2299/25708][Model Assisted Software Development - a MDE-Based Software Development
  Methodology]]: PhD thesis.

Whilst the content of this site is based on these papers, it may have been
modified a great deal since it was originally seeded from them, as our
understanding of the subject matter improved. In addition, we also added to it
all of the non-academic material created as part of the [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen][Dogen project]].
