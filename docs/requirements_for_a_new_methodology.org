#+begin_quote
Current modeling approaches, techniques and tools do not live up to the
challenge. Often, mature tools provide techniques that can successfully cope
with software systems that we were building a decade ago, but fail when applied
to model complex systems [...]. Some academic techniques propose interesting
ways of addressing these shortcomings, but the prototypical nature of academic
tools often prohibits their application to the development of real-world
software systems. --- Mussbacher /et al./ [cite:@mussbacher2014relevance]
#+end_quote

Several far-ranging themes emerged from [[id:6EBDB35D-8892-8964-6D03-393E013B74BA][State of the Art in Code Generation]] and
[[id:3310548C-2A30-0FA4-71F3-6E31EB98D498][The State of MDE Adoption]], as well as previous analysis
[cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_1] [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_2]
[cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_3]. The present document distils these themes into a
cohesive narrative of gaps exploitable by a new [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]]-based approach, linking each
requirement back to the theoretical or practical concerns which gave rise to it.
Since, in our view, application is inextricably linked with theory, we have
opted for two categories of requirements: requirements for the theoretical
framework (/cf./ Section [[id:66251FED-9382-1064-37F3-E14160524F03][Theoretical Framework Requirements]]) and requirements
related to tooling (/cf./ Section [[id:25AAE8FE-10C1-7C84-4B8B-D85D9CBDD5BB][Tooling Requirements]]). Each requirement is
comprised of a numbered requirement definition to facilitate cross-referencing
by the remainder of the dissertation[fn:req_def] and a short overview. Let us
start then by looking at what is deemed necessary from a theoretical standpoint.

[fn:req_def] /e.g./, [[id:570228FD-A3D0-5C24-350B-651EC203990A][RQ-01]] references the first requirement.


* Theoretical Framework Requirements
  :properties:
  :id: 66251FED-9382-1064-37F3-E14160524F03
  :custom_id: ID-66251FED-9382-1064-37F3-E14160524F03
  :end:

** RQ-01: Well-Defined Purpose
   :properties:
   :id: 570228FD-A3D0-5C24-350B-651EC203990A
   :custom_id: ID-570228FD-A3D0-5C24-350B-651EC203990A
   :roam_aliases: RQ-01
   :end:

#+name: rq-purpose
#+begin_requirement
The new approach will target a single, specific purpose, which is the automated
generation of schematic and repetitive code.
#+end_requirement

As explained at length in [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_2] (Chapter 2), [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] is a
vast body of knowledge with unclear boundaries. The new approach must avoid
these difficulties by explicitly defining its purpose and clarifying its
relationship with [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] and [[id:7FCC54A3-D2C3-0254-1C0B-103976AA8D87][MD*]]. In addition, the boundaries of the new approach
are circumscribed exclusively to AC-MDSD --- namely, to the automatic generation
of schematic and repetitive code (/cf./ [[id:AA611197-6A81-98B4-771B-3ADD903003B9][Architecture-Centric MDSD (AC-MDSD)]]).

** RQ-02: Well-Defined Identity
   :properties:
   :id: 7B9439C4-DF6D-15D4-9F23-483CFA520E1C
   :custom_id: ID-7B9439C4-DF6D-15D4-9F23-483CFA520E1C
   :roam_aliases: RQ-02
   :end:

#+name: rq-identity
#+begin_requirement
The new approach must have a cohesive and well-defined identity, distinct from
that of [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] and [[id:7FCC54A3-D2C3-0254-1C0B-103976AA8D87][MD*]].
#+end_requirement

Identity is a thorny problem within [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_2] (p. 10),
and thus a frequent source of confusion to newcomers. In addition to having a
well-defined purpose ([[id:570228FD-A3D0-5C24-350B-651EC203990A][RQ-01]]), any proposed solution must also have a
well-defined identity, explicitly distinct from all existing approaches within
[[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]]. An important consequence of a well-defined identity is that it will
facilitate macro-analysis of its application (/cf./ [[id:00120B1F-7E38-1924-CD63-B59FBA55DA52][Analysis of Evidence at a
Macro-Scale]]).

** RQ-03: Well-defined Target Audience
   :properties:
   :id: F328F253-223B-45E4-604B-97A93F54DFD3
   :custom_id: ID-F328F253-223B-45E4-604B-97A93F54DFD3
   :roam_aliases: RQ-03
   :end:

#+name: rq-target
#+begin_requirement
The new approach must be designed to serve specifically software engineers
inexperienced in [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]].
#+end_requirement

[[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] accumulates knowledge on the subject of modeling, serving many distinct
audiences in the software development process. As a consequence, it is difficult
to find an entry point into the body of knowledge [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_1],
[cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_2] (Chapter 2). The new approach must set out its
target audience explicitly; its focus is only on software engineers with little
to no knowledge of [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]]. The intent is not to discourage experienced [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]]
practitioners, but to bring clarity as to whom the approach is aiming to serve.
All decisions must take into account the target audience.

** RQ-04: Well-defined Domain Architecture
   :properties:
   :id: BF919862-66B8-9564-BD2B-50267AB69D7C
   :custom_id: ID-BF919862-66B8-9564-BD2B-50267AB69D7C
   :roam_aliases: RQ-04
   :end:

#+name: rq-domain-architecture
#+begin_requirement
Resolve ambiguity in terminology by means of a single, well-defined, domain
architecture that covers all core vocabulary.
#+end_requirement

A key part in establishing a well-defined purpose ([[id:570228FD-A3D0-5C24-350B-651EC203990A][RQ-01]]) and identity ([[id:7B9439C4-DF6D-15D4-9F23-483CFA520E1C][RQ-02]])
is to create a domain architecture that acts as the single source of truth for
the approach. [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] concepts that are difficult to define rigorously --- such as
[[id:8077C481-01C0-4384-1AA3-5DA290362463][TS]], platforms and the like --- must be made clear and unambiguous within the
domain architecture. In addition, these more rigorous definitions must not
disagree with their common usage within [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]].

** RQ-05: Cater for Evolution
   :properties:
   :id: A338D17B-F00B-0124-CE9B-AE2E8E693804
   :custom_id: ID-A338D17B-F00B-0124-CE9B-AE2E8E693804
   :roam_aliases: RQ-05
   :end:

#+name: rq-evolution
#+begin_requirement
In order to adapt continually to the needs of end-users, the domain architecture
must have an associated set of processes that cater for its continued evolution.
#+end_requirement

The domain architecture ([[id:BF919862-66B8-9564-BD2B-50267AB69D7C][RQ-04]]) must be designed for continuous extension in
order to remain relevant. The approach must define the processes by which it can
be updated, as well as the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of changes. This
requirement attempts to address France and Rumpe's warning regarding the
"widening of the problem-implementation gap" through evolution (/cf./ [[id:33796FA9-609B-0F64-C0F3-F4F04B844C10][MDA]]), and
reflects the importance placed on keeping up to date with changes on platforms
and [[id:8077C481-01C0-4384-1AA3-5DA290362463][TS]].

** RQ-06: SDM Integration
   :properties:
   :id: 1EC48874-83C9-B274-D403-3948B18D8E13
   :custom_id: ID-1EC48874-83C9-B274-D403-3948B18D8E13
   :roam_aliases: RQ-06
   :end:

#+name: rq-sdm-integration
#+begin_requirement
The new approach must be able to integrate seamlessly with existing [[id:8E4D171C-1FAE-FA74-0EA3-97F1125B8A2A][SDM]].
#+end_requirement

Given the limited scope of the new approach, software engineers will require an
overall process to manage the software development lifecycle via a traditional
[[id:8E4D171C-1FAE-FA74-0EA3-97F1125B8A2A][SDM]], which we call the host methodology. As with [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]], the new approach must be
agnostic to the host methodology being applied. Unlike [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]], the new approach
must integrate with its host without requiring any changes to the latter or to
itself.[fn:mde_sdm]

[fn:mde_sdm] The relationship between [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] and [[id:8E4D171C-1FAE-FA74-0EA3-97F1125B8A2A][SDM]] is discussed at length in
[cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_2] (Chapter 5).


** RQ-07: Clear Governance Model
   :properties:
   :id: 9989CB52-6283-1E04-BBDB-B53D57DBDD44
   :custom_id: ID-9989CB52-6283-1E04-BBDB-B53D57DBDD44
   :roam_aliases: RQ-07
   :end:

#+name: rq-governance
#+begin_requirement
The new approach must have a clear governance model, identifying the
responsibilities of all actors and allowing all interested parties to
contribute.
#+end_requirement

In order to allay concerns over cost, vendor lock-in and vendor survivability
(/cf./ [[id:4BE68ED9-C33A-09D4-2DFB-AB384D0F7F1A][External Organisational Factors]]), the approach and all of its components
must have a governance model that accepts contributions from a variety of
sources. The approach must include a process by which any interested party can
contribute changes. The governance model should be focused towards increasing
the number of use cases for the approach ([[id:4676F4D9-3DD0-DCE4-1DDB-07C632D440FF][RQ-11]]), in accordance to its purpose
([[id:570228FD-A3D0-5C24-350B-651EC203990A][RQ-01]]) and target audience ([[id:F328F253-223B-45E4-604B-97A93F54DFD3][RQ-03]]).

** RQ-08: Support for PIMs and PSMs
   :properties:
   :id: ABE6F956-F44E-9874-6823-556FF007CE4D
   :custom_id: ID-ABE6F956-F44E-9874-6823-556FF007CE4D
   :roam_aliases: RQ-08
   :end:

#+name: rq-pim-psm
#+begin_requirement
The modeling language must support [[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PIM]] as well as [[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PSM]].
#+end_requirement

The modeling language for the new approach must support both [[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PSM]] and [[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PIM]] (/cf./
[[id:33796FA9-609B-0F64-C0F3-F4F04B844C10][MDA]]). Platform independence must be built upon a set of well-defined mappings in
accordance with the domain architecture ([[id:F328F253-223B-45E4-604B-97A93F54DFD3][RQ-03]]), and extensible by users. Use of
[[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PIM]] must remain optional.

** RQ-09: Support for PDMs
   :properties:
   :id: F6E37D65-F879-8694-2EBB-5D55148BA63C
   :custom_id: ID-F6E37D65-F879-8694-2EBB-5D55148BA63C
   :roam_aliases: RQ-09
   :end:

#+name: rq-pdm
#+begin_requirement
The modeling language must support .
#+end_requirement

The new approach must cater for [[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PDM]]s.[fn:pdms] These provide mappings for
external building blocks, making them accessible by the methodology's modeling
language. [[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PDM]] must be extensible by users and subsequently incorporable into the
domain architecture ([[id:BF919862-66B8-9564-BD2B-50267AB69D7C][RQ-04]]) and tooling via a well-defined process.

[fn:pdms] In the sense defined in [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_2], Chapter 4 (p.
35); that is to say, a model responsible for mapping platform-level concepts
into the domain architecture.


** RQ-10: Limited Support for Variant Management and Product Lines
   :properties:
   :id: CE3A551A-4CE1-CE84-6993-CC580A970F2F
   :custom_id: ID-CE3A551A-4CE1-CE84-6993-CC580A970F2F
   :roam_aliases: RQ-10
   :end:

#+name: rq-variant
#+begin_requirement
The approach's modeling language must provide support for variant management and
product lines.
#+end_requirement

The modeling language put forward by the approach must include limited support
for product lines, constraining variability to a well-defined variability
space.[fn:variability_literature]

[fn:variability_literature] A review of the literature on variability falls
outside of the scope of the present work. For a high-level overview of the
subject --- as well as an analysis of its relationship with [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] --- see Chapter
6 of [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_2].


** RQ-11: Extensible Catalogue of Schematic and Repetitive Code
   :properties:
   :id: 4676F4D9-3DD0-DCE4-1DDB-07C632D440FF
   :custom_id: ID-4676F4D9-3DD0-DCE4-1DDB-07C632D440FF
   :roam_aliases: RQ-11
   :end:

#+name: rq-extensible
#+begin_requirement
The new approach must define a framework for the management of schematic and
repetitive code.
#+end_requirement

A framework for the management of schematic repetitive code (/cf./ [[id:33796FA9-609B-0F64-C0F3-F4F04B844C10][MDA]]) must be
defined as part of the domain architecture ([[id:BF919862-66B8-9564-BD2B-50267AB69D7C][RQ-04]]). It must include a catalogue
of the patterns already identified, including their taxonomy, variability and
dependencies, as well as outlining a process to identify and propose new
patterns.

* Tooling Requirements
  :properties:
  :id: 25AAE8FE-10C1-7C84-4B8B-D85D9CBDD5BB
  :custom_id: ID-25AAE8FE-10C1-7C84-4B8B-D85D9CBDD5BB
  :end:

** RQ-12: "End-to-End" Solution
   :properties:
   :id: DF8F82C6-36A4-E044-7223-9C701F610F7B
   :custom_id: ID-DF8F82C6-36A4-E044-7223-9C701F610F7B
   :roam_aliases: RQ-12
   :end:

#+name: rq-end-to-end
#+begin_requirement
The new approach must encompass all of the tooling required for its application.
#+end_requirement

In order to avoid the complexity created by heterogeneous tooling (/cf./
[[id:4BE68ED9-C33A-09D4-2DFB-AB384D0F7F1A][External Organisational Factors]]), the new approach must provide a single,
end-to-end solution for the modeling and generation of schematic and repetitive
code ([[id:4676F4D9-3DD0-DCE4-1DDB-07C632D440FF][RQ-11]]).

This entails specifying the behaviour of all necessary tooling ([[id:BF919862-66B8-9564-BD2B-50267AB69D7C][RQ-04]]) both in
terms of their inputs --- /i.e./ modeling languages --- and outputs --- /i.e./
programming languages. It also entails providing a comprehensive reference
implementation. Significantly, this requirement does not preclude integrating
with external tools, but instead attempts to minimise accidental complexity
within its core competences ([[id:570228FD-A3D0-5C24-350B-651EC203990A][RQ-01]]).

** RQ-13: Prioritise Black-Boxing
   :properties:
   :id: 5F450D39-B621-A904-816B-7C0B403F8BF8
   :custom_id: ID-5F450D39-B621-A904-816B-7C0B403F8BF8
   :roam_aliases: RQ-13
   :end:

#+name: rq-black-box
#+begin_requirement
Where possible, [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] concepts should be made invisible to end-users.
#+end_requirement

All tooling should use a black-box approach where possible. For example,
end-users are not expected to have access to a [[id:707BD590-1E59-56B4-D333-33525E43A78A][MT]] language to operate on the
input models; instead, from an end-user perspective, [[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PIM]] and [[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PSM]] must act as if
transformed directly into source code (/cf./ [[id:0A799746-01F2-8C94-DB6B-68ABEFB4B205][Technical Factors]]). More generally,
the approach should aim to promote tooling closer in spirit to special purpose
code generators [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_3] rather than to traditional [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]]
tools.

** RQ-14: Clear Separation of End-users and Tool Developers
   :properties:
   :id: 0B2736E7-8886-4974-3D43-98C66612DF73
   :custom_id: ID-0B2736E7-8886-4974-3D43-98C66612DF73
   :roam_aliases: RQ-14
   :end:

#+name: rq-separation
#+begin_requirement
There must be a clear separation of roles and responsibilities for all actors.
#+end_requirement

Closely related to [[id:5F450D39-B621-A904-816B-7C0B403F8BF8][RQ-13]] is the need for a clear demarcation of responsibilities
between those applying the new approach and those maintaining and extending it.
End-users --- the consumers of the approach --- should only be required to learn
a minimal set of modeling concepts in order to use it. Those working on the
approach itself are expected to be competent [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] practitioners.

Note that this requirement does not preclude allowing end-users to get involved
with tool development, but merely defines the distinct roles available.

** RQ-15: Prioritise Tooling Integration
   :properties:
   :id: FFF14933-2C13-FC94-4193-6C18F2279F3C
   :custom_id: ID-FFF14933-2C13-FC94-4193-6C18F2279F3C
   :roam_aliases: RQ-15
   :end:

#+name: rq-integration
#+begin_requirement
The new approach must be designed to integrate tightly with existing tooling and
workflows.
#+end_requirement

One of the most significant themes to come out of the adoption literature
analysis were deficiencies in tooling integration (/cf./ [[id:0A799746-01F2-8C94-DB6B-68ABEFB4B205][Technical Factors]]).
Consequently, the new approach must take special care in this regard, as
follows:

- *Reuse input formats*: instead of proposing new native representations for its
  modeling language, the new approach should focus on specifying mappings (via
  [[id:BF919862-66B8-9564-BD2B-50267AB69D7C][RQ-04]]) to existing modeling languages. These mappings are intended to cover
  tooling used by developers such as IDE and build systems, as well as existing
  modeling tools.
- *Standard error reporting*: the reporting of errors and warnings must be
  designed in accordance with existing tooling --- in particular those which are
  already well supported in contemporary development environments
  [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_3].
- *Minimal dependencies*: in order to facilitate integration, the reference
  implementation must be available as both as a command-line utility and as a
  library, with little to no external dependencies
  [cite:@marco_craveiro_2021_3].

The overall objective of these dimensions is to allow end-users to continue
using preferred toolsets and to cause minimal disruption to existing workflows.

** RQ-16: Support Incremental Use of Features
   :properties:
   :id: DEEB98C0-FF5A-75D4-98E3-94DD4EFAFF2D
   :custom_id: ID-DEEB98C0-FF5A-75D4-98E3-94DD4EFAFF2D
   :roam_aliases: RQ-16
   :end:

#+name: rq-incremental
#+begin_requirement
The approach must support different levels of use, from "basic" to "advanced".
#+end_requirement

Following on from [[id:1EC48874-83C9-B274-D403-3948B18D8E13][RQ-06]], end-users must be able to make use of the approach
according to their specific needs. These range from code-generation of trivial
[[id:6C44E7F3-4BEA-9524-810B-B1EE4EECF771][PSM]] ([[id:ABE6F956-F44E-9874-6823-556FF007CE4D][RQ-08]]) to the management of products and even entire product lines ([[id:CE3A551A-4CE1-CE84-6993-CC580A970F2F][RQ-10]]),
and thus span both top-down and bottom-up application (/cf./ [[id:17D8BDC5-A746-BD84-586B-6EC1165BFB82][Social Factors]]). As
a result, the domain architecture ([[id:BF919862-66B8-9564-BD2B-50267AB69D7C][RQ-04]]) must specify these different levels of
use, and define how they are to be supported by the approach and its tooling ---
with the objective of guiding users towards more advanced uses as their mastery
develops.

Last but not least, experienced [[id:C29C6088-B396-A404-9183-09FE5AD2D105][MDE]] practitioners should also be able to make
use of the approach if, and only if, such use cases do not raise the complexity
bar for the target audience ([[id:F328F253-223B-45E4-604B-97A93F54DFD3][RQ-03]]) and are within the remit of the approach's
purpose ([[id:570228FD-A3D0-5C24-350B-651EC203990A][RQ-01]]).

#+name: rq-conformance
#+begin_requirement
The new approach should include a comprehensive set of conformance tests to
validate implementations.
#+end_requirement

The reference implementation must be validated by a set of automated conformance
tests which determine the level of compliance. These can then be reused by
third-party implementations. Conformance tests must cover scalability --- /i.e./
expected behaviour for different model sizes --- as well as any available
integration with third party tooling.
