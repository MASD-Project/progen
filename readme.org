* Overview

Dogen is the reference implementation of the MASD Project code generator. MASD -
Model Assisted Software Development - is a new methodology for the development
of software systems based on MDE (Model Driven Engineering). MASD was developed
in the context of a PhD programme; if you are that way inclined, you may find
the thesis of interest: Model Assisted Software Development - a MDE-Based
Software Development Methodology.

In lay terms, Dogen's objective is to automate the development process as much
as possible: the user creates models using Org Mode, though these must respect a
set of predefined restrictions. Dogen uses this input to generate a source code
representation of the model. Unlike traditional modeling techniques like UML,
Dogen focuses instead on literate modeling - an approach based on Knuth's
Literate programming.

The generated code contains most of the functionality required from a typical
domain object such as serialisation, hashing, streaming and so on. Whilst we
intend for the application to be useful out of the box for most use cases, our
end goal is to enable users to extend Dogen, adapting it to the vagaries of
their specific needs. Note that Dogen has experimental C# support, but it is not
in feature parity with C++ support.
