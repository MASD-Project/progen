C++ is a programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell
Labs in 1979. It is an extension of the C language, providing object-oriented
programming features like classes and objects to it. The "++" in the name refers
to the fact that it is an improvement over C, with additional capabilities for
programming complex systems. C++ is widely used for system programming, game
development, and other performance-critical applications due to its efficiency
and versatility.
